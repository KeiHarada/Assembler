Description
================================================================================
The data set contains the air quality measurements made by 180 air quality
monitoring stations (deployed in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Province in China)
during 2013.2.8 - 2014.8.27. It is comprised of two data files: locations.txt
and measurements.txt, which are described as follows.

1. locations.txt: this data file specifies the GPS coordinates of the 180 air
quality monitoring stations. Each row corresponds to exactly one station with
the format: station_id, latitude, longitude.

2. measurements.txt: this data file contains the measurements of the 180
stations. Each row corresponds to one measurement made by a station at one
timestamp and has the format: station_id, time, PM25 AQI, PM10 AQI, NO2 AQI.

The research is a part of Urban Computing [2] Project in MSR.
